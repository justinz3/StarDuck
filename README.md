# StarDuck
StarDuck is a top-down two-player spaceship duel inspired by Star Fox. It allows players to control a starship in a two-dimensional plane, firing lasers and bombs (which explode into a ring of lasers) until they are the last one standing. The score and health of each player are kept track of and displayed. Highscores are stored in a text file. The game also allows players on the same WiFi network to play together over the internet, using the hostâ€™s IP address. The code for this project was written in Java and utilized forms of polymorphism such as abstract classes and interfaces. A detailed object-oriented design with minimized coupling makes new features easy to implement and adjust.

Made by Daniel Ivanovich and Justin Zhu for AP Java.
